EVTDESCgothic_war.1;The Byzantines are weak and vulnerable to attack after many years of protracted warfare. Many anxious warriors have amassed at Ravenna, anxiously waiting for your command to attack, should you ever give it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgothic_war.1;Those Greeks will cower under my might!;Ces grecs se replieront sous la puissance de mon armée!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBgothic_war.1;Uh... I'd rather not cause more trouble.;Je ne préfère pas causer plus de trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgothic_war.2;Your Grace, we have received disturbing reports that the blasted Totila has amassed a sizeable force of Ostrogoth Barbarians to advance the Gothic cause! What say thou?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgothic_war.2;I'll let my trusted General Narses handle this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBgothic_war.2;This is too much for me to handle, we must sue for peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCgothic_war.2;Bugger these petty savages, these rumours are a cruel jape!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgothic_war.3;For many years, your dynasty, the Amal, has ruled the great Ostrogothic Kingdom. Being partially Roman in culture has evidently caused much concern and distaste amongst many of your vassals and friends, perhaps you should consider converting cultures?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgothic_war.3;To hell with them! I have always been a Roman in spirit and blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBgothic_war.3;Perhaps it's for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgothic_war.4;The Amal dynasty has reigned in the glorious Ostrogothic realm for many years. Sadly, cultural differences between you and your rightful liege have strained relations significantly. However, a conversion to the Romano-Gothic culture will surely please your suzerain, and may have some hidden benefits to it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgothic_war.4;Well that's just too bad for him. I'm Ostrogothic and proud!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBgothic_war.4;I'll do it for the good of the realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCgothic_war.5;It has come to your attention that your Visigothic vassals are displeased with your Roman ways. If you are to please them, a conversion to Visigothic would keep peace in the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAgothic_war.5;Never! I cannot adhere to such a barbaric culture!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBgothic_war.5;It would be wise to please my vassals. Conversion isn't so bad after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
