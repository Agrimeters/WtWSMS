EVTNAMEins.4;The Synod of Whitby;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCins.4;In your wisdom, you have called a great Synod to be held, to finally determine the calculation of Easter. Summoning bishops representing Iona and Rome, it is hoped that the schism between the two rites can finally be solved.;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTAins.4;Let the Bishops be called!;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCins.5;The Bishops are now arriving, and it is you duty to preside and judge over this Synod, and both sides shall make their arguments to you.;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTAins.5;Let us begin.;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCins.6;First to make their arguments are the Bishops from Iona, who claim that their system is that of St. Columba, a man of absolute piety, who, in the traditions of St. John the Apostle, spread monestaries and Christianity throughout the Isles. To change the date would be to convict St. Columba and St. John with hersy.;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTAins.6;An interesting idea...;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCins.7;Now the Bishops of Rome made their arguments, citing the primacy of Rome as the heart and head of the faith, and claims that even the Egyptians adhered to the Roman way. The Roman Bishop ends stating that Peter had been given the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven by Christ, and he was the rock on which the Church would be built. He urges you to favour the holder of the keys.;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTAins.7;A compelling argument...;;;;;;x 
EVTDESCins.8;Now the weight of decision is incumbent upon you, to arbitrate the the fate of the Insular Church, along with the hold of Rome on the Isles. You decision will have longlasting consequences on the future of all Britain.;;;;;;x

EVTDESCins.13;Off in distant Britain, a Synod has ruled against the Roman Rite, upholding their own, blasphemous ways. Should you decide, you may comdemn the Insular church as heretical, but this may lead to uneeded bloodshed.;;;;;;x
