EVTDESC_ROM_1000;The locals, whose vulgarate has changed so much from its classical roots, have begun to call themselves by the name of their conquerors--"Franc." The Romano-Gauls of Francia are becoming Frenchmans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_1000;Pah! The peasants no longer want to be "Roman..." how fitting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_1000;Honhonhon civilizing baguette! A mon avis, le français est la langue supérieure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_1100;The language and customs of the local Romano-Gauls have deviated enough from their classical roots such that they can no longer be called "Roman.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_1100;What the peasants do is of no interest to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_1100;Peasants embracing civilization? Who would've thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_1150;The Visigoths of the Garonne valley, who have been rapidly Romanized in the past centuries, no longer maintain a position as the dominant class under foreign rule. With no differences in social and political class separating them from their fellow latin-speaking ilk, the Visigoths of Gaul are beginning to melt into the rest of the Romano-Gallic population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_1150;Good riddance. These lands will never be theirs again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_1150;Even the peasants feel the pull of Roman civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2000;With the Visigoths embracing the Nicene faith, the remaining minor differences between the Gothic ruling social class and the Hispani peasants and nobles are fading away. Both groups are starting to consider themselves one-and-the-same in this province, where they have embraced a united indentity as the gens of the rex Gothorum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_2000;Let us embrace the unifying cultural identity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ROM_2000;NO. We will never merge with these peasants in name or custom...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2001;With native Celt-iberian rule long gone, the remaining Celts are starting to assimilate with their Romano-Hispanic neighbors, adopting their tongue and customs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_2001;And the tongue spoken by the peasants concerns me how, herald?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ROM_2048;With native celtic rule long gone, the remaining Gauls are starting to assimilate with their Romano-Gallic neighbors, adopting their tongue and customs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ROM_2048;...And these peasant matters concern me how, again?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
