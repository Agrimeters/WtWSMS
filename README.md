#When the World Stopped Making Sense

A Dark Ages mod for CK2! 

Allows you to play from 476 (Fall of Western Roman Empire) to 1453 (Fall of Eastern Roman Empire). Bookmarks will feature the 476-700 period, with possible extensions. Some added bookmarks are Shattered Empire (480), The Gothic Wars (535) and Frankish steel (486). Flavour, historical setup and accurate gameplay mechanics for the period are of course also featured.

### Developers & Testers

Because portraits DLC compatibility required to use sub-mods, it's no longer possible to clone directly Git repo inside mod folder.
To run the mod from a Git local repository:
- Clone the repository to Git default location (for instance C:\Users\username\git\)
 - If you already have a local Git repository inside the CKII mod folder, simply move the root WTWSMS folder (containing the .git folder) elsewhere, Git itself won't care that the folder has moved.
 - Alternatively, you can also delete the WTWSMS folder (**Warning**: make sure all your local work is commited & pushed to github, otherwise keep a backup copy !) and re-clone the repository from Github to another location
- Run create_symbolic_links.bat to create symbolic links from CK2 mod folder to the actual folders in your Git working directory
- Copy over all the .mod files from Git folder to CKII mod folder (you will need to re-copy them occasionally when they change in Git).
